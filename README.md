# Train Lending Club data (fairified)
This namespace is used for the FAIR Data Engineering course at the University of Twente in 2025 to fairify Train Lending Club financial loan data.
The group (group 12) consisted of Kiona Bijker and Ragunath Seenivasagan. 

## Namespace
* main - redirects to the repository top folder
* originalData - redirects to the original data's csv
* ontology/rdf - redirects to the rdf file of the Protege ontology created in this project
* ontology/owlXML - redirects to the owl compatible xml file generated by Protege
* semanticModel - redirects to the updated semantic model that uses vocabulary names
* dataSHACL - redirects to the shacl that can be used to validate the data's triplets
* data - redirects to the fairified data Turtle file
* metadataSHACL - redirects to the shacl to generate a metadata form for Fair Data Point uploads of the data

## Original dataset
The original dataset was published on Kaggle at https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?query=lending%20club%20-site%3Akaggle.com&docid=L2cvMTFzand2ZHJzYg%3D%3D

## Pre-fairification
Before the dataset could be used for the course it needed to be reduced. First columns were removed, leading to train-lending-club-columns-used.csv . Then the number of records was reduced to 1000 while preserving all variations possible using main.py , this resulted in train-lending-club-filtered1000.csv

## Outside vocabularies
Vocabularies used include FIBO, mainly the loan applications ontology (https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/LOAN/LoansGeneral/LoanApplications/) and wikidata. These vocabularies were extended using Protege, see FAIRscripts-Protege.rdf or Protege Fair Data group12.owx

## SHACL
Both for the data itself and for the metadata a shacl file was produced for validation. These files can be run using validater.py which outputs to validation.log 
.
The shacl-train-lending-club-filtered1000-csv.ttl describes the fairified data triplets and can be used to verify that future records are accurately triplified. 

meta-shacl-train-lending-club.ttl describes the metadata form for Fair Data Point uploads of this dataset.
